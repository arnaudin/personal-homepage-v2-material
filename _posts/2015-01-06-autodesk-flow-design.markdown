blurb: Flow Design has been called the "easiest-to-use CFD program ever." 
---
[Flow Design](http://www.autodesk.com/store/flow-design) is a virtual wind tunnel that makes airflow simulation accessible to any level engineer, architect, or product designer. 

Matching the mental model of a wind tunnel with real-time feedback we abstract away the complexities of running traditional computational fluid dynamics. Flow Design feels light weight and playful to encourage hands-on design exploration.

**Flow Design Standalone**

Even more compelling, Flow Design embeds simulation workflows directly in the native design environment, making the evaluation of design changes quick and seamless.

#### Role

Responsibilities included:

- Design strategy
- User research
- Heuristic evaluation
- User stories
- Wireframes and mockups
- Refining HTML/CSS layout
- Visual design (icons, UI components)

Before Flow Design was released as a full commercial product, it existed as an experimental technology preview to find product-market fit called Project Falcon.

I provided high-level design guidance, basic research, and usability evaluation for the Project Falcon MVP which was intended to be a flexible bare bones experiment to gage demand. For example, the radial menu pictured here wasn't perfect on any one platform, but was part of a single-build environment that worked on all major platforms (mobile & desktop, touch & mouse).

Sufficient market interest was identified, and I served as design lead to prepare Falcon for commercial release as Flow Design. We found the serious users were on Windows, so the first step was to redesign the UI and tailor usability for a desktop experience.

In addition to designing for the platform, the redesign provided an opportunity to eliminate unused features, emphasize top features, and optimize the workflow based on what we had learned from early adopters.

#### Impact

The product has seen commercial success, and Roopinder Tara, Director of Content at ENGINEERING.com [called](http://www.worldcadaccess.com/blog/2014/08/autodesk-flow-design-the-easiest-to-use-cfd-program-ever.html) Flow Design the "*easiest-to-use CFD program ever.*" 

The thing I love about designing products to empower people is that they will inherently be used in unpredictable ways. For example...

**Superbowl XLVIII**

Flow Design and Autodesk Simulation provided the technology behind the wind simulation for Superbowl XLVIII.

**National Youth Science Day**

As a testament to the ease of use, elementary school students around the country were introduced to Flow Design on [National Youth Science Day](http://academy.autodesk.com/4h), as part of a rocket building activity. This photo is from an event I volunteered at in San Rafael, California. The kids required no explanation!
