blurb: This is a test blurb describing Autodesk Flow Design.

Flow Design is a virtual wind tunnel that makes airflow simulation accessible to any level engineer, architect, or product designer. Using the metaphor of a wind tunnel and real-time feedback we abstract away the complexities of running traditional computational fluid dynamics.

Additionally, Flow Design embeds simulation workflows directly in the native design environment, making the evaluation of design changes quick and seamless.

#### Role

Responsibilities included:

- Design strategy
- User research
- Heuristic evaluation
- User stories
- Wireframes and mockups
- Visual design

Before Flow Design was released as a full commercial product, it existed as an experimental technology preview called Project Falcon.

I provided design guidance, basic research, and usability evaluation for the Project Falcon MVP which was intended to be a flexible bare bones experiment. For example, the radial menu pictured here wasn't perfect on any one platform, but worked on all (mobile & desktop, touch & mouse).

Once we found a market of interested users with Falcon, I served as design lead to prepare it for commercial release as Flow Design. Serious users were on Windows, so the first step was to redesign the UI for desktop usability.

In addition to designing for the platform, the redesign provided an opportunity to eliminate unused features, emphasize top features, and optimize the workflow based on what we had learned from early adopters. 

#### Additional Impact

The thing I love about designing product to empower people is that they will inherently be used in unpredictable ways. For example...

##### Superbowl

Flow Design and Autodesk Simulation provided the technology behind the wind simulation for Superbowl XLVIII.

##### National Youth Science Day

As a testament to the ease of use, elementary school students around the country were introduced to Flow Design on National Youth Science Day, as part of a rocket building activity. This photo is from an event I volunteered at in San Rafael, California.
