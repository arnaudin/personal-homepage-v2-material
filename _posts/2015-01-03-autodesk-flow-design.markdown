blurb: This is a test blurb describing Autodesk Flow Design.

Flow Design is a virtual wind tunnel that makes airflow simulation accessible to any level engineer, architect, or product designer. Using the metaphor of a wind tunnel and real-time feedback we abstract away the complexities of running traditional computational fluid dynamics.

Additionally, Flow Design embeds simulation workflows directly in the native design environment, making the evaluation of design changes quick and seamless.

#### Role

Responsibilities included:

- Design strategy
- User research
- Heuristic evaluation
- User stories
- Wireframes and mockups
- Visual design

Before Flow Design was released as a full commercial product, it existed as an experimental technology preview called Project Falcon.

I provided design guidance, basic research, and usability evaluation for the Project Falcon MVP which was intended to be a flexible bare bones experiment. For example, the radial menu pictured here wasn't perfect on any one platform, but worked on all (mobile & desktop, touch & mouse).

Once we found a market of interested users with Falcon, I served as design lead to prepare it for commercial release as Flow Design. Serious users were on Windows, so the first step was to redesign the UI for desktop usability.

In addition to designing for the platform, the redesign provided an opportunity to eliminate unused features, emphasize top features, and optimize the workflow based on what we had learned from early adopters.
