### Projects

#### Bike Light Mount

After several prototypes, I settled on a design that could be easily mounted with an M5 bolt, using either a threaded or unthreaded eyelet (with nut).

#### Coffee Grinder Hack

The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001802PIQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001802PIQ&linkCode=as2&tag=ryanarna-20&linkId=UVOYMNHMT7RI533J">Hario Skerton</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=ryanarna-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001802PIQ" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is a good value hand grinder for the price, but develops a wobble over time due to the wear of the metal grinder shaft against a plastic part at a single point of contact. Ultimately this leads to uneven coffee grind sizes. 

I designed this simple pair of parts to hug the shaft at a second, lower point of contact. This prevents the shaft from wobbling, thus preventing wear and keeping the grind size consistent.

#### Hand Strap Mounting System

How might we attach a safe, comfortable strap to a bodysurfing handplane? It should be adjustable, strong, buoyant, and resistant to salt water.

I am experimenting with custom kevlar/nylon composite prints. These are super strong and light. I also have designs I may machine from wood or metal in the future.

### CNC

Having completed the [beginners course](http://www.instructables.com/id/Learn-CNC-The-Hard-Way/) on CNC at Autodesk's Pier 9, here are some starter projects I have been working on. 

#### Handplanes

A bodysurfing handplane (or handboard) is a small surfcraft for your hand. Depending on size and shape it can be used to more easily get barreled, help with optimal position on the wave face, and/or get more speed in the water. 

This handplane was cut out on a ShopBot. From there, I used a orbital and belt sanders to refine the shape.

#### Custom Chocolates

For a unique gift, I machined a positive from wax and then created a silicone mold to make custom chocolates.

I used Fusion 360 on the software side, and an Othermill desktop CNC mill for the machining.

From there, I created several chocolates in the mold using Tcho baking chocolate. This gift was a hit on all levels!

#### Generative Design for Additive Manufacturing

I am fascinated by the potential of generative design for additive manufacturing.

I have been exploring [generative designs](https://gallery.autodesk.com/fusion360/projects/generative-design-aeropress-plunger) for an [Aeropress](https://gallery.autodesk.com/fusion360/projects/aeropress-coffee-maker) plunger.
