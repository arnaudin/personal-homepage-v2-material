I have experience leading usability studies, product usability benchmarks, end-to-end experience studies, heuristic evaluations, focus groups, and participatory design workshops.

Note: most the findings from these studies cannot be shown publicly. Identifying features have been scrubbed from the assets below which are intended to give a general feel. 

#### LUMA

I have completed the following [LUMA](https://www.luma-institute.com/) trainings and have been using this approach to human-centered innovation for over a year:

- LUMA Introduction to Innovation through Human-Centered Design
- LUMA Advancing Innovation through Human-Centered Design
- LUMA Advanced Facilitation Pilot

The LUMA approach consists of numerous research methods (in addition to synthesis & creation) that I have practiced with both internal stakeholders and users. For example:

- Interviewing 
- Think-Aloud Testing
- Stakeholder Mapping to understand the human side of a system
- Rose Thorn Bud, Visualize the Vote, and Affinity Clustering to solicit feedback
- What's on Your Radar for prioritization
- Abstraction Laddering to reconsider problem statements

#### Usability Benchmarking

To quantify and track product usability, our team established a biennial full-product usability study. I worked with a research professional to implement this study -- I developed the user tasks, set up the sessions, served as notetaker and recorder, and was liaison to the product team. 

In addition to the findings, this was the first big opportunity to get our development team observing users directly. I worked closely with the team to make sure developers attended sessions, and presented the findings periodically to the team.

By running the benchmark with 15-20 users and measuring completion rate, time on task, and satisfaction we are able to establish an overall product usability index, and also break it down by key functional areas. For this particular study I identified over 80 usability and bug fix opportunities. 

The benchmark was so successful in illustrating the importance of usability that we have prioritized a "top usability" initiative for each release for the past three years including 5-10 of the top issues.

#### Total Experience Mapping

##### Framework

As Autodesk has been moving from perpetual desktop licenses to connected subscription services, the full end-to-end user experience has become more important than ever for acquiring and retaining customers.

The total experience mapping project was an undertaking to develop a framework for the company that would allow us to map and measure the experience to improve it over time. The framework was synthesized from a series workshops in which I participated alongside many cross-divisional and cross-functional colleagues.

##### Total Experience Study

This study took a multifaceted approach to apply the framework, starting by mobilizing internal stakeholders from all functional areas. This was a crucial step, instilling an early sense of ownership in the findings, opportunities, and actions. 

With a user researcher I planned, facilitated, and analyzed the following:

- Stakeholder interviews with functional leads (support, sales, marketing, etc.)
- Heuristic evaluations with functional experts
- In-lab usability testing with users
- Customer satisfaction surveys
- Community analysis across forums and social

##### Outcomes

One of the most valuable outcomes was the alignment and collaboration that arose from bringing together the various stakeholders and empowering them to identify and own opportunities in their functional area. We identified about 100 of these opportunities for improvement. I presented our story and findings at the first Autodesk UX summit in the fall of 2014.

##### Experience Map

A core deliverable was a consolidated experience map that provides a concise picture of what a user is doing, thinking, and feeling at each subphase in the customer journey. It combines quantitative data with real quotes and observations. This has been used to get buy-in from leadership, begin cross-functional collaborative conversations, and mobilize the development teams.
