Recently, I had the pleasure of shaping a surfboard with local shaping master [Gordon Guptill](http://www.sunsetshapers.com/gordon-guptill/). We settled on a design direction that would suit my experience and style, then got to work over two sessions. Being my first time in the shaping room, and with the goal of having a kick-ass board at the end, Gordon took on the larger operations and coached me through the finer work. 

This experience was a blast, and Gordon was super patient to answer all my questions and explain everything in detail as we went along.
