90 emerging women leaders from Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East spent the day at Autodesk in San Francisco as part of the 2016 [TechWomen](https://www.techwomen.org/) program. These women are a true inspiration, excelling in the fields of science, technology, engineering, math, education, and medicine. 

As part of the program, we offered workshops throughout the day. [Taylor](https://twitter.com/taylor_stein) and I taught 3D modeling & CAD using Fusion 360 while [Chris from You3Dit](https://www.you3dit.com/) got the group feeling empowered to turn their 3D designs into real, physical objects. 

Most of the women in the workshops had never made a 3D model before, but as a testament to the wills and skills of this group, by the end everyone had sculpted an aircraft and parametrically modeled a water bottle cap. 

Here are a few photos from the event:
