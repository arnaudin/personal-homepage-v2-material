blurb: This is a test blurb describing Autodesk CFD.

Autodesk CFD aims to be a professional-level yet easy-to-use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool for engineers. In essence this means it is an approachable fluid flow & heat transfer simulation tool. 

Autodesk CFD is designed upon the philosophy of simulating product and architectural design performance early and often in the design cycle, which enables engineers to explore more variation digitally to arrive at cheaper and better performing real-world designs.

I have been the UX lead for Autodesk's computational fluid dynamics (CFD) apps since 2011. I have supported the following releases:

- Autodesk Simulation CFD 2012
- Autodesk Simulation CFD 2013
- Autodesk Simulation CFD 2014
- Autodesk Simulation CFD 2015
- Autodesk CFD 2016

Prior to that I was involved in the design, testing, and release of eight consecutive on-time quarterly releases of CFdesign simulation software, which was acquired by Autodesk and further developed as Simulation CFD.

In this role my responsibilities span product design & strategy, user research, interaction design, UI design, design planning & facilitation, prototyping, visual design, usability testing, and design evangelism.
