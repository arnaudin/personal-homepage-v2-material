blurb: Autodesk Netfabb is a software suite for 3D printing and additive manufacturing. My work has focused on the Simulation Utility, which allows engineers to simulate metal 3D printing processes.

[Autodesk Netfabb](https://www.autodesk.com/products/netfabb/overview) is software for streamlining 3D printing and additive manufacturing workflows. 

I have been Lead Designer for the Netfabb Simulation Utility since late 2016. This product allows engineers to simulate metal printing processes for complex parts in order to predict part distortion, avoid support structure failure, and avoid damage to expensive hardware. 

Being a new product, I have been involved in significant industry and user research, as well as strategy and planning of a product roadmap. We are able to function like a startup within a larger company, so we move fast to test our hypotheses in working code in a tight feedback loop with new users. 

More to come soon...
