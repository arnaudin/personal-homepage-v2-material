blurb: A fun, simple open source site that generates excuses for not cycling. 
---
[Coyote Bail Squad]({{ site.url }}/sites/coyotebailsquad/) is a random excuse generator I built for the [Coyote Bomb Squad](http://coyotebombsquad.com/), a local cycling crew that I ride with. 

We are a tight group of friends who are never short on excuses for why we won't be able to make the group ride the next morning. It's great having a crew to hold you accountable but a bummer when your buddies bail. I built the site as a parody and a place to save our best excuses (all excuses have actually been said!).

[Fork it](https://github.com/arnaudin/coyotebailsquad/) on Github.
