#### Handplanes

A bodysurfing handplane (or handboard) is like a small surfboard for your hand. Depending on size and shape it can be used to more easily get barreled, get more optimal position on the wave face, and/or get more speed. 

This handplane was drawn as a 2D vector and cut out on a ShopBot. From there, I used a orbital and belt sanders to shape the rails, deck, and bottom.
