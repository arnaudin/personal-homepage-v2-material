#### Handplanes

A bodysurfing handplane (or handboard) is a small surfboard for your hand. Depending on size and shape it can be used to more easily get barreled, help with optimal position on the wave face, and/or get more speed in the water. 

This handplane was drawn as a 2D vector and cut out on a ShopBot. From there, I used a orbital and belt sanders to shape the rails, deck, and bottom.

#### Custom Chocolates

For a unique Valentines Day gift, I created a mold for a custom chocolate piece.

After a handful of concept sketches, I modeled variations of the chocolate positive in Fusion 360.

I then took the model through CAM for Fusion for programming, and then to the OtherMill software. The positive was cut from machine wax on an OtherMill dekstop CNC mill. 

One I cleaned up the positive, it was time to create the mold. To do this, I build temporary walls around the positive and poured in a two part, food safe silicone that sat for about a day. 

From there, I created several chocolates in the mold using Tcho baking chocolate. This gift was a hit on all levels!

#### Coming soon

More CNC work coming soon! I have become fascinated with manufacturing processes and am in the process of getting certified for the CNC Shop at Autodesk's Pier 9 workshop. Here are a few models I am working on:
