Last weekend at [Tour de Fat](https://www.sfbike.org/event/fat_2015/) I became the [100th person](http://www.newbelgium.com/Events/tour-de-fat/CarTrader) to give up my car and commit to a year of biking.

For background, I had been considering getting rid of my car since moving to SF, realizing that it's nonessential in the city and adds a bunch of stressful overhead. Hearing that New Belgium had not found a volunteer car trader leading up to TdF, and were looking for someone on-site was the push I needed to take the plunge into a car-less lifestyle. Upon hearing that the proceeds from the car sale would be donated to charity and New Belgium would supply funds for me to get a new bike at a local bike shop, I was sold on the idea and rushed backstage... 

The trade ended up involving a skit, culminating in me rising through a trap door on a bike, surrounded by aliens who threatened to destroy the world. I didn't catch it all since I was crouched under the stage, but my donation got them to change their minds. It was as ridiculous as it looks:
