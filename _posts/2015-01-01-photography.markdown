As a designer and maker, I am constantly seeking inspiration from other disciplines. While I thoroughly enjoy the process and practicality  of photography on its own, it also has a huge influence on how I design. 

Many of the visual overlaps are direct: the importance of composition & layout, balance, color, contrast, texture & patterns, motion & flow through a scene/screen, etc. 

Beyond that, one of the most important lessons for me has been working within constraints and eventually coming to embrace as an essence of the work. 

When you take a photograph, you are forced to tell a story in a single, rectangular frame. Depending on your gear, process, and the environment there will be numerous additional constraints including, but certainly not limited to: available light, focal range, film speed, color processing, subjects in motion, etc. A talented photographer uses these constraints to add to the story that the final image embodies.  The same can be said about a talented designer. 

My interest in photography started with an old film SLR in high school, but really took off around 2004 when I purchased a Canon [300D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_300D) digital SLR which enabled me to shoot essentially as much as I wanted.

It didn't take long to get connected with other student photographers at my university, and soon I was shooting for the newspaper and yearbook. This afforded me unbelievable opportunities and access to shoot subjects ranging from sports, music, speakers, architecture, portraits, and of course news.

For the past several years, my relationship with photography has evolved. Today I take more photos than ever, but also have less gear than ever (currently: mobile phone and a full-feature digital compact). There's a saying, "the best camera is the one that's with you." I'm a big believer
