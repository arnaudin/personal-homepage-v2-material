blurb: Making the simulation workflow more connected, collaborative, and interactive.
---
The design feedback loop provided by simulation is a part of a collaborative and interactive process. The Simulation Viewer is a step towards making results broadly sharable and available anywhere, along with additional collaboration features such as annotation and commenting. We like to think of it as a Google Doc for simulation.

I designed UI, interactions, and visual components for the simulation layer of the viewer, which was built on top of existing Autodesk 3D viewing technology.

##### Outcome

Our work on this project was integrated into the A360 web viewer, A360 mobile app, and Autodesk Labs Sim 360 project.
