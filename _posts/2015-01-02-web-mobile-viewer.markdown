blurb: With the ability to run any number of cloud simulation jobs in parallel, and with each taking up to hours to solve, it is desirable to monitor them on the go. The Simulation Job Monitor provides a way to check progress and status.

#### Problem and Hypothesis 

Through dozens of onsite customer visits and interviews, I participated on a research team that tested and confirmed a hypothesis that simulation collaboration workflows had not kept pace with the increasing role that simulation plays throughout the product design process. Technology in the workplace had also been rapidly evolving, yet we were not taking advantage of web and mobile capabilities. 

#### Strategy

From our research we identified the need to make analysis approachable to non-technical stakeholders; to provide connected access to the tools for analysis, review, and decision-making; and to allow [remote monitoring for simulation jobs]({% post_url 2015-01-04-mobile-job-monitor %}). 

#### Solution

I designed the UI, interactions, and visual components of the simulation layer for a web and mobile result viewer built on top of existing Autodesk technology.

Our work on this project was integrated into the A360 web viewer, A360 mobile app, and Autodesk Labs Sim 360 project.
