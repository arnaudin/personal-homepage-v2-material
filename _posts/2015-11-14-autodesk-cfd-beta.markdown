The latest [Autodesk CFD beta](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/cfd-general-discussion/cfd-2017-beta-test-opportunity/td-p/5906340) is now available. 

Here's a splash screen I put together with the primary goal of having it instantly differentiable from installed release versions, so that users don't run studies unintentionally in beta software. The working name for this release may or may not be Raven, hence the graphic.

I spent a lot of this release focusing on usability in the results environment, and ultimately if we've done a good job I suspect this is something folks will *not* notice since it will not stand out. However, I am confident the changes that have been implemented will make everyones' jobs easier and more efficient.

- Surface Wrap
- Custom Result Quantities
- Traces
- Iso Volume
