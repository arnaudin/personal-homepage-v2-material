As a practicing designer with a background in engineering and over 9 yrs of professional experience in software product development, I am able to balance creative and analytical approaches to define, explore, and solve complex problems. I have designed commercial software for [desktop]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2015-01-10-autodesk-cfd.markdown %}), [web]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2015-01-02-web-mobile-viewer.markdown %}), and [mobile]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2015-01-04-mobile-job-monitor.markdown %}). I have personally [developed free]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2016-01-10-fusion-airfoil-app.markdown %}) and experimental apps, so have empathy for the challenges software developers face. 

I consider myself a technologist with a humanist approach; I care deeply about people, believe in the value of the human experience, and am a technology enthusiast. My purpose is to leverage design, engineering, and technology to empower and serve people in productive, meaningful ways.

I have hands-on experience in all phases of the modern product development process. I can lead product design, support myself & team with research and testing, facilitate the innovation process, and act as a strategic partner. I am experienced with a variety of development methods from waterfall to agile, and always find a way to bring collaboration, human-centered design, and iterative learning into the process. 

I believe design should be used as an accelerator, differentiator, validator, and risk mitigator in the pursuit of the larger goals of the organization, so I am not afraid to resist design for design's sake. 

#### Approach 

I strive to be a capable, full-stack designer (i.e. generalist). I believe in breaking up problems into testable pieces that can be measured through experimentation in real world contexts. That said, I have worked on teams across the waterfall-agile spectrum and believe that ultimately process should not be trendy or dogmatic, but must serve the team and the desired outcome.

My strengths include:

- Design vision & strategy
- UX, UI, and interaction design
- Design approaches for agile development teams
- Bringing a human approach to deeply technical teams
