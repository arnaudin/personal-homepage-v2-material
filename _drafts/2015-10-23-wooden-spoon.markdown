This past week we hosted an internal design conference in San Francisco ([#xsummit15](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23xsummit15)). I found the event to be valuable in a number of ways:

- As someone who works primarily on distributed product teams, spending time with colleagues face-to-face
- Meeting people who I knew previously from emails or calls, and being able to share experiences with them
- Learning how the company is [evolving in terms of design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-maturity-stages-5-8/), and how employees are pushing the boundaries of design, research, and related technology
- Hearing how our customers are designing a new and better world

The content was incredible, and the interactions were invaluable. As is typical though for a multi-day heavy-interaction event, I found myself feeling the need to get away from the buzz later in the afternoons. Normally I'd sneak out for a walk or maybe grab tea somewhere to collect my thoughts, reflect, and get some quiet time to myself.
